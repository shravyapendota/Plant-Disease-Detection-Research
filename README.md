# Plant-Disease-Detection-ResearchHere's the combined version of your **README.md** file, including the **repository description** and **device features**:  

---


## 📌 **Overview**  
This repository contains my research on an **Offline Plant Disease Detection Device** that helps farmers **identify plant diseases directly in their fields** without needing internet access or expert assistance. The device uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for **image analysis**, providing real-time disease detection and recommendations.  

## 🚀 **Key Features**  


### 📸 **AI-Powered Image Analysis**  
- Uses **CNNs** to analyze plant images and classify diseases accurately.  
- Compares leaf patterns with a trained dataset to provide instant results.  

### 🔋 **Portable & User-Friendly**  
- Lightweight, **easy to carry**, and designed for field use.  
- **Simple interface** with minimal buttons for non-tech-savvy farmers.  
- Runs on a **rechargeable battery** for continuous operation.  

### 📊 **Instant Results & Diagnosis**  
- Displays disease information **immediately** after scanning.  
- Provides **remedies and preventive measures** for detected diseases.  
- Stores previous scans for **offline history tracking**.  

### 🛠️ **Cost-Effective & Scalable**  
- Designed to be **affordable** for farmers in developing regions.  
- Can be **upgraded with more plant disease data** for better accuracy.
